Repository for the Work Experience Week at MSSL (2022)

This repository holds jupyter notebooks for students that attend the WEW. It has been created with the idea that students will progress as far as possible witin it, and will leave with an understanding of some basic programming concepts and resources for further learning the language in the form of the Python Taster Session. 

Feel free to come back to this repository and play with the code anytime!
