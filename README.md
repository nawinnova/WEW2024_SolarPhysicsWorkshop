Repository for the 'Solar Physics Python Workshop' session -  MSSL Space Science Week 2024

In this workshop, you will have a chance to become a novice solar physicist and learn the basics of solar physics through hands-on coding experience. We will start by learning the basics of Python programming (calculation, plotting, dealing with data, etc.). Then, we will explore and analyse the solar image data using Python, including studying the Sunâ€™s short-term evolution, calculating the speed of coronal mass ejections, and more.

This repository holds jupyter notebooks for students that attend this workshop session. It has been created with the idea that students will progress as far as possible witin it, and will leave with an understanding of some basic programming concepts and resources for further learning the language in the form of the Python Taster Session. 

Feel free to come back to this repository and play with the code anytime!
